However, the diff does not show removal of any now-unused CSS keyframes/classes that may have been dedicated to the removed car/bus animations.",

      "requirement": "No CSS keyframes/classes remain that are only used for the removed car/bus animations (e.g., slide-right).",
      "reason": "The diff summary only shows changes to the hero component; it does not show any CSS/Tailwind animation keyframe/class cleanup (e.g., in global CSS or Tailwind config). Therefore this acceptance criterion cannot be verified as implemented.",
